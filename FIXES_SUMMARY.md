# Fixes and Improvements Summary

## 1. Fixed Incomplete Control Flow Issue

### Problem
The PuzzleBuilder was throwing "Incomplete control flow - missing else() or build()" error because:
- If statements were being created without corresponding else clauses
- The action routing logic was creating incomplete if-else chains

### Solution
1. **Updated action routing logic** in `src/coinscript/parser.ts`:
   - Ensured every if statement has a corresponding else clause
   - Fixed the if-else chain generation for multiple actions
   - Added proper handling for default actions

2. **Fixed IfStatement generation**:
   - All if statements now generate else clauses (even if empty)
   - This ensures the PuzzleBuilder's control flow is always complete

## 2. Implemented Send with Optional Memo

### Changes Made
1. **Removed transfer keyword** - consolidated functionality into send()
2. **Updated send() to support optional memo**:
   - `send(recipient, amount)` - creates coin without memo
   - `send(recipient, amount, memo)` - creates coin with memo
3. **Updated PuzzleBuilder.createCoin()** to support optional memo parameter

## 3. Simplified Storage and State Syntax

### Changes Made
1. **Storage and state can now be declared without blocks**:
   ```coinscript
   // Old syntax (still supported)
   storage {
       address owner = "xch1...";
   }
   
   // New syntax (also supported)
   storage address owner = "xch1...";
   ```

2. **Both syntaxes work for multiple declarations**:
   ```coinscript
   // Block syntax for multiple
   storage {
       address owner = "xch1...";
       uint256 maxSupply = 1000000;
   }
   
   // Or individual declarations
   storage address owner = "xch1...";
   storage uint256 maxSupply = 1000000;
   ```

## 4. Address Validation

- Integrated `@dignetwork/datalayer-driver` for proper address to puzzle hash conversion
- Validates xch1 (mainnet) and txch1 (testnet) prefixes
- Converts addresses to puzzle hashes automatically

## 5. State and Event Simplification

- State variables are now just regular variables (no automatic state layer)
- Events compile directly to coin announcements (no notification layer)
- Layers are only added when explicitly requested

## 6. Comprehensive Test Suite

Created extensive test coverage in `examples/` including:
- Basic action tests (single, default, multiple)
- Storage variable tests (single, multiple, different types)
- State variable tests
- Send functionality (with and without memo)
- Event emission tests
- Control flow (if, if-else)
- Expression evaluation (arithmetic, boolean logic)
- Complex examples combining multiple features

## Next Steps

To use the framework:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cd examples
   node test-all-features.js
   ```

3. Create your own CoinScript files using the examples as templates

## Key Improvements

1. **Cleaner output** - mod is always the outermost structure
2. **More intuitive syntax** - storage/state declarations are simpler
3. **Better error handling** - control flow issues are prevented
4. **Comprehensive functionality** - send with memo, proper address handling
5. **Extensive test coverage** - validates all features work correctly
